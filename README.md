# ImgOrg
A basic WinForm app for sorting photos into folders organized by the date an image was created.

## How to Use the application
The basic functions are pretty self explanitory.  Though, it is worth pointing out that after images are found and are listed in the result grid you can double click on any cell to open the file explorer to the location that the image is stored in.  If the image location doesn't exist yet, for instance when running a dry run, nothing will happen when you double click the cell.
